Our final project is a chat platform designed for counselors and patients, accessible via a web interface and LINE Bot. This platform integrates Azure's translation, language, sentiment analysis services, App Service, Gemini's image generation, and large language model responses. It also utilizes OpenAI's Whisper technology to process user voice input. The chatbot can handle text, images, and voice responses in real time and compiles analyzed data to be sent to counselors, assisting them in diagnosing users' emotional states during subsequent sessions. Additionally, chat records are automatically saved to Azure Storage, ensuring that each conversation can seamlessly continue.
